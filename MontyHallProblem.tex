We have 3 doors to choose from.


Define a numeric sequence between 1 and 3


Doors = 1:3 


The command sample(,n) takes a sample of size n from our set of values.

Here we just want to select one door to be our "correct door" and another to be the door the contestant selects.


These are independent so we perform the selection for both seperately.








Correct = sample(Doors,1)

Choice = sample(Doors,1)
 


Equivalently we could use the uniform distribution to pick numbers.


# Choice=floor(runif(1,1,3))



A wrong door must be selected to be opened. 


The door selected by the contestant can not be chosen.

First lets select the doors that must stay closed, then find the ones we can choose from to open









StayClosed = union(Correct, Choice)


CanOpen = setdiff(Doors, StayClosed)
 



Sample() poses an interesting problem. Lets look at the help file to see what it is.










if(length(CanOpen)>1)

{

Open = sample(CanOpen,1) 

}else {Open=CanOpen}


NotOpen = setdiff(Doors,Open)


Stick = Choice

Switch = setdiff(NotOpen,Choice)


Stick==Choice

Switch==Choice

StickCount = 0

SwitchCount = 0


for(i in 1:1000)

#Define a numeric sequence between 1 and 3


Doors = 1:3 



Correct = sample(Doors,1)





# Door 1 :  Correct answer



# Which door does the contestant choose?


Choice=floor(runif(1,1,3))


# Equivalently

# Choice = sample(Doors,1)



# A wrong door must be selected to be opened. 

# The door selected by the contestant can not be chosen.

# First lets select the doors that must stay closed 


StayClosed = union(Correct, Choice)



CanOpen = setdiff(Doors, StayClosed)





if(length(CanOpen)>1)

{

Open = sample(CanOpen,1) #Problem here

}else {Open=CanOpen}


NotOpen = setdiff(Doors,Open)


Stick = Choice


Switch = setdiff(NotOpen,Choice)




StickCount = StickCount + as.numeric(Stick  ==  Correct)

SwitchCount = SwitchCount + as.numeric(Switch  ==  Correct)


}
