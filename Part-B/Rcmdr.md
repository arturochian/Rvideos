 R commander is probably the most user friendly gui available on R and is widely used by novices of the
 language because for each analysis run it displays the underlying R code. It can be installed from within 
 R itself. R commander can be used on Microsoft Excel through the RExcel package. R commander is regarded as 
 the most viable R-alternative to commercial statistical packages such as SPSS. 
 The R commander menus are easily configurable through plug-in packages.
