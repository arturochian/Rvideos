Usage

beta(a, b)
lbeta(a, b)

gamma(x)
lgamma(x)
psigamma(x, deriv = 0)
digamma(x)
trigamma(x)

choose(n, k)
lchoose(n, k)
factorial(x)
lfactorial(x)


 - simple statistical functions
  - measures of centrality
-mean(),median()
- measures of variability
-sd(), mad(), IQR()
-range() returns a vector containing the minimum and maximum of all the given arguments. 
-IQR() computes interquartile range of the x values.
	    - quantiles

 -var, cov and cor compute the variance of x and the covariance or correlation of x and y if these are vectors. If x and y are matrices then the covariances (or correlations) between the columns of x and the columns of y are computed.
 -cov2cor scales a covariance matrix into the corresponding correlation matrix efficiently. 

Pearson's Chi-squared Test for Count Data
chisq.test performs chi-squared contingency table tests and goodness-of-fit tests.
