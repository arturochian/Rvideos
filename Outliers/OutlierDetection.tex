\subsection{Outlier Detection}
One of the first steps towards obtaining a coherent analysis is the detection of outlaying observations. Although outliers are often considered as an error or noise, they may carry important information (see Mandelbrot/Taleb).

Detected outliers are candidates for aberrant data that may otherwise adversely lead to model misspecification, biased parameter estimation and incorrect results. It is therefore
important to identify them prior to modelling and analysis.

Outlier detection methods have been suggested for numerous applications, such as credit card fraud detection, clinical trials, voting irregularity analysis, data cleansing, network intrusion, severe weather prediction, geographic information systems and athlete performance analysis.
