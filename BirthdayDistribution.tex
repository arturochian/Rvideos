The Birthday function
The R command pbirthday() computes the probability of a coincidence of a number of randomly chosen people sharing a birthday, given that there are n people to choose from.
Suppose there are four people in a room. The probability of two of them sharing a birthday can be computed as follows:
> pbirthday(4)

Answer:  about 1.6 %
How many people do you need for a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday?
(starting from 2 â€“ so the 5th element corresponds to 6 people, etc)

The answer is 23 people - probably much less than you thought!!
