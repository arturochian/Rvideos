Merging Data
========================================================

### Adding Columns
To merge two data frames (datasets) horizontally, use the merge function. In most cases, you join two data frames by one or more common key variables (i.e., an inner join).

- merge two data frames by ID 

```
total <- merge(data frameA,data frameB,by="ID")
```

- merge two data frames by ID and Country

```
total <- merge(data frameA,data frameB,by=c("ID","Country"))
```

### Adding Rows

To join two data frames (datasets) vertically, use the rbind function. The two data frames must have the same variables, but they do not have to be in the same order.
```
total <- rbind(data frameA, data frameB)
```
If data frameA has variables that data frameB does not, then either:
 - Delete the extra variables in data frameA or
 - Create the additional variables in data frameB and set them to NA (missing) before joining them with **rbind( )**.
